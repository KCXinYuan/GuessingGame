Here there are six questions that will mystify and boggle anyone that takes it, except for Kevin Chuang of course.

  <h2>The questions are as followed</h2>
  <h3>Do I play video games?</h3>
  <h3>Do I work at night?</h3>
  <h3>Am I originally from Seattle?</h3>
  <h3>What is my age?</h3>
  <h3>Do I like licorice flavored licorice?</h3>
  <h3>What day in March is my birthday?</h3>
