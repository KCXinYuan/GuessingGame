  <p>This is a guessing game about the one and only Kevin Chuang of the Code Fellows 201 evening course. Here there are six questions that will mystify and boggle anyone that takes it, except for Kevin Chuang of course. He knows what's up (he should know about himself or that would just be sad because he made the answers).</p>

  <h2>The questions are as follows</h2>
  <h3>Do I play video games?</h3>
    <p id='qOne'></p>
  <h3>Do I work at night?</h3>
    <p id='qTwo'></p>

    <p id='qFive'></p>
